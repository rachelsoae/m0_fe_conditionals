# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
Very confident, as long as I remember to use === when actively coding :)
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Also very confident.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
Pretty confident, except that I am sure there are more efficient ways to write the statements than what I am currently doing. I get nervous about 
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
1 hour 20 minutes, compared to my estimate of 45 minutes
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Now that I have hammered the === into my head, I think I will be able to move much more quickly. I'm going to go back to assuming at least 1 hour for all assignments, even if it's right after class. I'm also going to budget time to preview material the night/day before.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I can't think of any questions at this time.
